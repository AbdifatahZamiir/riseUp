Business innovation is when companies implement new processes, ideas, services, or products with the goal of boosting the bottom line. It could mean launching new and improved products or services (which can lead to higher revenue), making an existing process more efficient, or solving a current business problem (both of which cut down on costs and save time). The key element of innovation is that it drives revenue for the company.

We will be organizing an Innovation Week to support and celebrate businesses that are already innovating and disrupting their respictive marekts with new aproaches, This week is to also promote innovation within businesses, filled with discussions, innovation competitions and many more.

The week will bring many experts and innovators to discuss and share their knowledge on the subject as well as inspire growing businesses to innovate in order to tremondously succeed.
