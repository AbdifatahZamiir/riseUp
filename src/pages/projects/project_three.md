How to build a successful startup? Well, some of the most successful examples showcase that often an idea shored up with a tiny bit of resources and tons of luck may create a miracle.

But what to do when the idea is raw, unstructured, and in need of assessment and guidance, not to mention resources and skills?

Here comes a tech startup accelerator. Itâ€™s a program or even an entire organization that helps startups ideate, validate, establish, boost, or even pivot their product and lead it on an entrepreneurial journey.
